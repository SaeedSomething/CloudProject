Okay, I can help you with that. Based on the assignment details in cloud-project.txt and assuming you have docker-compose.yml and service code (Auth and Notification), I'll provide the necessary Kubernetes YAML files, Kind cluster setup instructions, and the Kind configuration file. However, since I don't have access to your actual docker-compose.yml or service code, I'll have to make some assumptions. You'll need to adapt these to your specific project.

Assumptions:

Services: You have two services: Auth and Notification.
Databases: Each service has its own database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MySQL).
Networking: Services communicate with their databases and potentially with each other.
Docker Compose Structure: I'll assume a typical structure where each service has its own section in docker-compose.yml, defining its image, ports, environment variables, etc.
1. Kind Cluster Setup

a) Install Kind:

If you don't have Kind installed, follow the instructions at https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/. It usually involves downloading a binary and making it executable.

b) Kind Configuration File (kind-config.yaml):

yaml
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
nodes:
- role: control-plane
- role: worker
- role: worker
This configuration creates a cluster with one control plane node and two worker nodes, meeting the assignment requirement.

c) Create the Cluster:

bash
kind create cluster --config kind-config.yaml
2. Kubernetes YAML Files

I'll create separate YAML files for each component, organized by namespace. Let's assume namespaces auth-ns and notification-ns.

a) Auth Namespace (auth-ns.yaml):

yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: auth-ns
b) Notification Namespace (notification-ns.yaml):

yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: notification-ns
c) Auth Service (auth-deployment.yaml, auth-service.yaml, auth-configmap.yaml, auth-secret.yaml, auth-pvc.yaml):

Deployment (auth-deployment.yaml):

yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: auth-deployment
  namespace: auth-ns
spec:
  replicas: 1  # Adjust as needed
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: auth
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: auth
    spec:
      nodeSelector:
        node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: "" # Schedule on a worker node
      containers:
      - name: auth-service
        image: your-auth-image:latest  # Replace with your actual image
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080  # Adjust to your service's port
        envFrom:
        - configMapRef:
            name: auth-config
        - secretRef:
            name: auth-secret
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: "500m"
            memory: "512Mi"
          requests:
            cpu: "250m"
            memory: "256Mi"
        volumeMounts:
        - name: auth-data
          mountPath: /var/lib/postgresql/data  # Adjust for your database
      volumes:
      - name: auth-data
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: auth-pvc
Service (auth-service.yaml):

    port: 80
    targetPort: 8080  # Match containerPort in deployment
  type: ClusterIP  # Restrict access within the cluster
ConfigMap (auth-configmap.yaml):

yaml

  DATABASE_PASSWORD: "your_password_base64"
  # ... other secrets
Important: Replace "your_username_base64" and "your_password_base64" with the Base64-encoded versions of your actual credentials. You can use the base64 command-line tool for this: echo -n "your_username" | base64

Persistent Volume Claim (auth-pvc.yaml):

yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: auth-pvc

spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi  # Adjust storage size as needed
d) Auth Database (auth-db-deployment.yaml, auth-db-service.yaml, auth-db-pvc.yaml):

Deployment (auth-db-deployment.yaml):

yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: auth-db-deployment
  namespace: auth-ns
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: auth-db
  template:

      labels:
        app: auth-db
    spec:
      nodeSelector:
        node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: "" # Schedule on a worker node
      containers:
      - name: auth-db
        image: postgres:latest  # Or your preferred database image
        ports:
        - containerPort: 5432
        env:
        - name: POSTGRES_USER
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: auth-secret
              key: DATABASE_USERNAME
        - name: POSTGRES_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: auth-secret
              key: DATABASE_PASSWORD
        - name: POSTGRES_DB
          value: auth_db
        volumeMounts:
        - name: auth-db-data

Persistent Volume Claim (auth-db-pvc.yaml):

yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: auth-db-pvc
  namespace: auth-ns
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi  # Adjust storage size as needed
e) Notification Service and Database (notification-*.yaml):

Create similar YAML files for the Notification service and its database, following the same structure as above, but within the notification-ns namespace. Remember to adjust image names, ports, environment variables, and other details to match your Notification service.

3. Deployment Instructions

Apply Namespaces:

bash
kubectl apply -f auth-ns.yaml
kubectl apply -f notification-ns.yaml
Apply Resources within each Namespace:

For Auth:

bash
kubectl apply -f auth-configmap.yaml -n auth-ns
kubectl apply -f auth-secret.yaml -n auth-ns
kubectl apply -f auth-pvc.yaml -n auth-ns
kubectl apply -f auth-db-pvc.yaml -n auth-ns
kubectl apply -f auth-db-deployment.yaml -n auth-ns
kubectl apply -f auth-db-service.yaml -n auth-ns
kubectl apply -f auth-deployment.yaml -n auth-ns
kubectl apply -f auth-service.yaml -n auth-ns
For Notification (replace auth-ns with notification-ns and adjust filenames):

bash
kubectl apply -f notification-configmap.yaml -n notification-ns
kubectl apply -f notification-secret.yaml -n notification-ns
# ... and so on for all Notification resources
4. Networking

If your services need to communicate with each other, you'll need to expose them appropriately. Since the assignment specifies maintaining the networking from the Docker Compose phase, you'll need to analyze your docker-compose.yml to see how the services were connected. If they communicated directly by service name, the ClusterIP services created above should be sufficient. If you used specific ports or other mechanisms, you might need to adjust the service definitions or consider using an Ingress controller for external access.

Important Notes:

Image Names: Replace placeholder image names (e.g., your-auth-image:latest) with the actual names of your Docker images. Make sure these images are available in your Kind cluster (you might need to load them using kind load docker-image your-image:tag).
Ports: Double-check that the ports defined in your services and deployments match the ports your applications are actually listening on.
Environment Variables and Secrets: Carefully review and update the ConfigMap and Secret files with your actual environment variables and sensitive credentials. Remember to Base64-encode the secret values.
Resource Limits: Adjust the CPU and memory limits in the deployment definitions based on the actual resource requirements of your services.
Persistence: The PVCs and PVs ensure data persistence. Make sure the storage size requested in the PVCs is sufficient for your databases. You might need to create Persistent Volumes (PVs) manually in your Kind cluster if you want to control the storage location. If you don't create PVs, Kind will automatically provision them using its default storage class.
Node Selection: The nodeSelector ensures that each deployment runs on a worker node.
Docker Compose Logic: Thoroughly analyze your docker-compose.yml to ensure that all networking and service dependencies are correctly translated to the Kubernetes environment. For example, if services in Docker Compose communicated via a shared network, you might need to create a NetworkPolicy in Kubernetes to allow communication between the namespaces.
Testing: After deploying, thoroughly test all services and their interactions to ensure everything is working as expected. Use kubectl get pods -n <namespace> to check pod status, kubectl logs <pod-name> -n <namespace> to view logs, and kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -n <namespace> -- /bin/bash to get a shell inside a pod for debugging.
Remember to adapt this template to your specific project. If you provide your docker-compose.yml and service code, I can give you a more precise configuration.
